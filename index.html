                <b>Marty, will</b> we ever see you again? Wait a minute, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that you built a time machine out of a delorean. Working. Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother. Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now. You do? Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.

                <b>Back to</b> the future. Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her. Yeah, where does he live? Right. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.
